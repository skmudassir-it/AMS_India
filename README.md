This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new).

### Deployment Steps:

1.  **Push your code** to a GitHub repository.
2.  **Import the project** in Vercel.
3.  **Configure Environment Variables**: This is a CRITICAL step. In the Vercel project settings, add the following variables from your `.env.local`:
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
4.  **Deploy**: Vercel will build and deploy your application.

### Troubleshooting "Failed to collect page data":
If you see an error like `Failed to collect page data for /blog/[slug]`, it means the build process tried to fetch data from Supabase but couldn't. This is usually because:
-   The Environment Variables are not added to Vercel.
-   The Supabase URL or Key is incorrect.

Ensure these variables are added in **Vercel -> Project Settings -> Environment Variables**.
